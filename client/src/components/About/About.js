I have a strong interest in full-stack development, but am equally excited to work either on the front or back end. Additionally, I love spending my free time learning new programming skills and getting involved with the community. I love working collaboratively with a like-minded team to ensure optimal results for user-centered and technology-centered designs.</p>
